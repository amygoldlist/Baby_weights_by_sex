### `results`

This folder contains the results from the various scripts.  The images are used in the final report.  Once the `make all` command is run, this should contain three new files:
* *baby_data.csv*
* *summary_stats.csv*
* *test_values.txt*

The `images` folder will contain the following two files
* *baby_histogram.png*
* *make_graph.png*

When `make clean` is run, only this `README` file and the empty `images` folder will remain.
