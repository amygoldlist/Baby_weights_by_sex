# Baby weights by sex
## Do girls weigh more than boys at birth?
### Amy Goldlist

What are the differences between male and female babies at birth?  Is there a size difference?  I've used the data set ["Live births, by birth weight and sex, Canada, provinces and territories"](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/ea67173c-4f76-4259-83e5-557e97ae85fd) available through the Government of Canada Open Data website.  This dataset contains data on babies born between 2000 and 2014, classified by sex and weight range.

My hypothesis on starting was that female babies weigh more than male babies at birth, but in fact my analysis has shown that male babies weigh more on average than female babies at birth!

In the next release, I would like to look at the effect of province or territory or birth on birthweights.
